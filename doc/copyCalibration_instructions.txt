Purpose
-------
To copy metadata for calibrations to new entries, nearly identical to the
originals except for flavor.

Prerequisites
-------------
In order for copyCalibration to know how to connect to the database you need
a file .my.cnf in your home directory, readable and writable only by you,
containing database host, username and password.  Since files in your home
afs directory cannot be suitably protected, the actual file .my.cnf goes 
in your .ssh directory.  You then create a symbolic link to it in your home
directory.  In detail:

1. In ~/.ssh create the file .my.cnf (unless it already exists, in which
case you'll add to it)
2. For connection to the production database, add the following 4 lines

[copyCalibration]
host=glastCalibDB.slac.stanford.edu
user=<mysql-account-name>
password=<mysql-account-password>

where <mysql-account-name> is replaced by the actual account and
<mysql-account-password> is replaced by the actual password.
It will be in plain text, but this is ok since the file is readable only
by you.



3. Create a symbolic link to the file in your home directory:

$   cd
$   ln -s .ssh/.my.cnf  .my.cnf

Usage
-----
copyCalibration can be found in recent GR builds under

<top-of-build>/bin/<variant-directory>/copyCalibration

where <variant-directory> is something like
redhat5-i686-32bit-gcc41-Debug  or
redhat6-x86_64-64bit-gcc44-Debug
or either of those with "Debug" replaced by "Optimized".

This file is a wrapper script: it first defines environment variables such
as LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately, then invokes the program.  Do not
source this file; just run it by typing the full path.


It takes as input 
* a file containing a list of serial numbers of calibration metadata to be
  copied to entries with a different flavor.  Each line in the file should
  consist of an integer followed by a carriage return.  Other lines will
  be ignored.
* the new flavor
* Prod or Test (optional)

If the last argument is omitted, copyCalibration will search the production
database to confirm that calibrations of the specified serial numbers do
exist there, but will not write new entries.  Specify 'Prod' to write to 
the production database (calib); 'Test' to write to calib_test.

To connect to calib_test you would need a section in your .my.cnf
starting with [copyCalibration_test] and appropriate account name and
password (they're not the same as for the production database).
I don't think anyone has a reason to write to calib_test except me.
